# AsteroidMitigation
 
AsteroidMitigation is a solar system simulation that demonstrates the use case and effectivness of laser-based Asteroid Mitigation Systems (AMS). 

AsteroidMitigation does the following  
- Models the solar system and the tileted, uneven, inconsistent orbits of the planets
- Simulates the second lagrange point and a satellite that orbits around it
- Demonstrates the effectivness of laser-based AMS. 
- Allows the user to focus on specific planets
- Allows the user to change the time scale of the simulation
